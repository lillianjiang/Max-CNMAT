The main goal for this patch is to play with our own sound.

By moving mouse horizontally and vertically through the screen, users can change the timestrech and pitch, respectively. 

If user moves the mouse pass over 1300/1440 part of the screen, a beep sound would be triggered, making the sound more annoying. :)

Enjoy.

Something important steps:
1. Toggle on Loop and TimeStrech.
2. Toggle on microphone.
